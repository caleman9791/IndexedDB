Interfaces
To get access to a database, call open() on the indexedDB attribute of a window object. This method returns an IDBRequest object; asynchronous operations communicate to the calling application by firing events on IDBRequest objects.

Connecting to a database
IDBFactory
Provides access to a database. This is the interface implemented by the global object indexedDB and is therefore the entry point for the API.

IDBOpenDBRequest
Represents a request to open a database.

IDBDatabase
Represents a connection to a database. It's the only way to get a transaction on the database.

Retrieving and modifying data
IDBTransaction
Represents a transaction. You create a transaction on a database, specify the scope (such as which object stores you want to access), and determine the kind of access (read only or readwrite) that you want.

IDBRequest
Generic interface that handles database requests and provides access to results.

IDBObjectStore
Represents an object store that allows access to a set of data in an IndexedDB database, looked up via primary key.

IDBIndex
Also allows access to a subset of data in an IndexedDB database, but uses an index to retrieve the record(s) rather than the primary key. This is sometimes faster than using IDBObjectStore.

IDBCursor
Iterates over object stores and indexes.

IDBCursorWithValue
Iterates over object stores and indexes and returns the cursor's current value.

IDBKeyRange
Defines a key range that can be used to retrieve data from a database in a certain range.

IDBLocaleAwareKeyRange Non-standard
Defines a key range that can be used to retrieve data from a database in a certain range, sorted according to the rules of the locale specified for a certain index (see the options parameter to IDBObjectStore.createIndex().) This interface isn't part of the 2.0 specification.

Custom event interfaces
This specification fires events with the following custom interface:

IDBVersionChangeEvent
The IDBVersionChangeEvent interface indicates that the version of the database has changed, as the result of an IDBOpenDBRequest.onupgradeneeded event handler function.
